Firstly Read HTML notes , if you want to see some practical example then you an go to the specific chapter and see its index.html file.<br>
Then same for CSS notes.<br>
In CSS - flexbox, animations,transition,transform,responsive websites(media queries,vh,vw),margin,border,padding,position property are important.<br>
Make some projects.<br>
My first CSS/HTML project is about a Restaurant Main page.<br>
Now I started learning CSS frameworks, first framework that I started learning was TailwindCss.<br>
To setup TailwindCSS in VSCode, watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUunolbb1xU&list=PLu0W_9lII9ahwFDuExCpPFHAK829Wto2O&index=3 from 7:54 min or see this screenshot.<br>

After learning Tailwind CSS, I made my first tailwind css project which is Microsoft Clone Website . You can check that project on my github repository.
