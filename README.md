Firstly Read HTML notes , if you want to see some practical example then you an go to the specific chapter and see its index.html file.<br><br>
Then same for CSS notes.<br><br>
In CSS - flexbox, animations,transition,transform,responsive websites(media queries,vh,vw),margin,border,padding,position property are important.<br><br>
Make some projects.<br><br>
My first CSS/HTML project is about a Restaurant Main page.<br><br>
Now I started learning CSS frameworks, first framework that I started learning was TailwindCss.<br><br>
To setup TailwindCSS in VSCode, watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUunolbb1xU&list=PLu0W_9lII9ahwFDuExCpPFHAK829Wto2O&index=3 from 7:54 min or see this screenshot.<br><br>

After learning Tailwind CSS, I made my first tailwind css project which is Microsoft Clone Website . You can check that project on my github repository.<br><br>
Now after Tailwind Css, I started learning Javascript from scrimba and I made notes in my notebook(DSA wala) and made some projects which are in javascript projects repo <br><br>
After doing that course , I learnt Async,Await,Callback, Promises from freecodecamp youtube . For notes of that video, there is one article go through that once for revision - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-async-await-tutorial-learn-callbacks-promises-async-await-by-making-icecream/ . <br><br>
I also learnt about APIs from freecodecamp and made a weather app using rapid api.(Notes are in the notebook).<br><br>
